:trophy: I'm a Front-end developer :computer: who is enthusiastic and passionate about making software. I have hands-on experience in a wide range of software, tools and programming languages. I take great care in the user experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.

:heart: Besides my work I enjoy setting up scaled down distributed systems with `Raspberry PI 4` :strawberry: cluster.
